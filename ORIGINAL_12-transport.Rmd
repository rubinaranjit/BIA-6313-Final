## A case study of Bristol {#bris-case}

The case study used for this chapter is located in Bristol, a city in the west of England, around 30 km east of the Welsh capital Cardiff.
An overview of the region's transport network is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:bristol), which shows a diversity of transport infrastructure, for cycling, public transport, and private motor vehicles.

Another issue with small zones is related to anonymity rules.
To make it impossible to infer the identity of individuals in zones, detailed socio-demographic variables are often only available at a low geographic resolution. 
Breakdowns of travel mode by age and sex, for example, are available at the Local Authority level in the UK, but not at the much higher Output Area level, each of which contains around 100 households.
For further details, see www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography.
```



```{r 12-transport-5}
names(bristol_zones)
```


```{r 12-transport-6}
nrow(bristol_od)
nrow(bristol_zones)
```



```{r 12-transport-7}
zones_attr = bristol_od %>% 
  group_by(o) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, sum) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(geo_code = o)
```


```{r 12-transport-8}
summary(zones_attr$geo_code %in% bristol_zones$geo_code)
```

The results show that all 102 zones are present in the new object and that `zone_attr` is in a form that can be joined onto the zones.^[
It would also be important to check that IDs match in the opposite direction on real data.
This could be done by changing the order of the IDs in the `summary()` command --- `summary(bristol_zones$geo_code %in% zones_attr$geo_code)` --- or by using `setdiff()` as follows: `setdiff(bristol_zones$geo_code, zones_attr$geo_code)`.
]
This is done using the joining function `left_join()` (note that `inner_join()` would produce here the same result):
\index{join!inner}
\index{join!left}

```{r 12-transport-9}
zones_joined = left_join(bristol_zones, zones_attr, by = "geo_code")
sum(zones_joined$all)
names(zones_joined)
```

The result is `zones_joined`, which contains new columns representing the total number of trips originating in each zone in the study area (almost 1/4 of a million) and their mode of travel (by bicycle, foot, car and train).
The geographic distribution of trip origins is illustrated in the left-hand map in Figure \@ref(fig:zones).
This shows that most zones have between 0 and 4,000 trips originating from them in the study area.
More trips are made by people living near the center of Bristol and fewer on the outskirts.
Why is this? Remember that we are only dealing with trips within the study region:
low trip numbers in the outskirts of the region can be explained by the fact that many people in these peripheral zones will travel to other regions outside of the study area.
Trips outside the study region can be included in regional model by a special destination ID covering any trips that go to a zone not represented in the model [@hollander_transport_2016].
The data in `bristol_od`, however, simply ignores such trips: it is an 'intra-zonal' model.

In the same way that OD datasets can be aggregated to the zone of origin, they can also be aggregated to provide information about destination zones.
People tend to gravitate towards central places.
This explains why the spatial distribution represented in the right panel in Figure \@ref(fig:zones) is relatively uneven, with the most common destination zones concentrated in Bristol city center.
The result is `zones_od`, which contains a new column reporting the number of trip destinations by any mode, is created as follows:

```{r 12-transport-10}
zones_od = bristol_od %>% 
  group_by(d) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, sum) %>% 
  dplyr::select(geo_code = d, all_dest = all) %>% 
  inner_join(zones_joined, ., by = "geo_code")
```

A simplified version of Figure \@ref(fig:zones) is created with the code below (see `12-zones.R` in the [`code`](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/tree/master/code) folder of the book's GitHub repo to reproduce the figure and Section \@ref(faceted-maps) for details on faceted maps with **tmap**\index{tmap (package)}):

```{r 12-transport-11, eval=FALSE}
qtm(zones_od, c("all", "all_dest")) +
  tm_layout(panel.labels = c("Origin", "Destination"))
```

```{r zones, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Number of trips (commuters) living and working in the region. The left map shows zone of origin of commute trips; the right map shows zone of destination (generated by the script 12-zones.R).", message=FALSE, fig.scap="Number of trips (commuters) living and working in the region."}
source("https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/raw/master/code/12-zones.R", print.eval = TRUE)
```

## Desire lines

We have already loaded data representing desire lines\index{desire lines} in the dataset `bristol_od`.
This origin-destination (OD) data frame object represents the number of people traveling between the zone represented in `o` and `d`, as illustrated in Table \@ref(tab:od).
To arrange the OD data by all trips and then filter-out only the top 5, type (please refer to Chapter \@ref(attr) for a detailed description of non-spatial attribute operations):

```{r 12-transport-12}
od_top5 = bristol_od %>% 
  arrange(desc(all)) %>% 
  top_n(5, wt = all)
```

```{r od, echo=FALSE}
od_top5 %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = paste("Sample of the top 5 origin-destination pairs in the",
                    "Bristol OD data frame, representing travel desire",
		    "lines between zones in the study area."),
    caption.short = "Sample of the origin-destination data.",
    booktabs = TRUE)
```

The resulting table provides a snapshot of Bristolian travel patterns in terms of commuting (travel to work).
It demonstrates that walking is the most popular mode of transport among the top 5 origin-destination pairs, that zone `E02003043` is a popular destination (Bristol city center, the destination of all the top 5 OD pairs), and that the *intrazonal* trips, from one part of zone `E02003043` to another (first row of Table \@ref(tab:od)), constitute the most traveled OD pair in the dataset.
But from a policy perspective, the raw data presented in Table \@ref(tab:od) is of limited use:
aside from the fact that it contains only a tiny portion of the 2,910 OD pairs, it tells us little about *where* policy measures are needed, or *what proportion* of trips are made by walking and cycling.
The following command calculates the percentage of each desire line that is made by these active modes:

```{r 12-transport-13}
bristol_od$Active = (bristol_od$bicycle + bristol_od$foot) /
  bristol_od$all * 100
```

There are two main types of OD pair:
*interzonal* and *intrazonal*.
Interzonal OD pairs represent travel between zones in which the destination is different from the origin.
Intrazonal OD pairs represent travel within the same zone (see the top row of Table \@ref(tab:od)).
The following code chunk splits `od_bristol` into these two types:
<!-- displayed as straight black lines in \@ref(fig:desire). -->

```{r 12-transport-14}
od_intra = filter(bristol_od, o == d)
od_inter = filter(bristol_od, o != d)
```

The next step is to convert the interzonal OD pairs into an `sf` object representing desire lines that can be plotted on a map with the **stplanr**\index{stplanr (package)} function `od2line()`.^[
`od2line()` works by matching the IDs in the first two columns of the `bristol_od` object to the `zone_code` ID column in the geographic `zones_od` object.
Note that the operation emits a warning because `od2line()` works by allocating the start and end points of each origin-destination pair to the *centroid*\index{centroid} of its zone of origin and destination.
<!-- This represents a straight line between the centroid of zone `E02003047` and the centroid of `E02003043` for the second origin-destination pair represented in Table \@ref(tab:od), for example. -->

```{r 12-transport-15, warning=FALSE}
desire_lines = od2line(od_inter, zones_od)
```

An illustration of the results is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:desire), a simplified version of which is created with the following command (see the code in `12-desire.R` to reproduce the figure exactly and Chapter \@ref(adv-map) for details on visualization with **tmap**\index{tmap (package)}):

```{r 12-transport-16, eval=FALSE}
qtm(desire_lines, lines.lwd = "all")
```

```{r desire, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Desire lines representing trip patterns in Bristol, with width representing number of trips and color representing the percentage of trips made by active modes (walking and cycling). The four black lines represent the interzonal OD pairs in Table 7.1.", fig.asp=0.8, fig.scap="Desire lines representing trip patterns in Bristol."}
source("https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/raw/master/code/12-desire.R", print.eval = TRUE)
```

The map shows that the city center dominates transport patterns in the region, suggesting policies should be prioritized there, although a number of peripheral sub-centers can also be seen.
Next it would be interesting to have a look at the distribution of interzonal modes, e.g. between which zones is cycling the least or the most common means of transport. 

## Routes

From a geographer's perspective, routes are desire lines\index{desire lines} that are no longer straight:
the origin and destination points are the same, but the pathway to get from A to B is more complex.
Desire lines\index{desire lines} contain only two vertices (their beginning and end points) but routes can contain hundreds of vertices if they cover a large distance or represent travel patterns on an intricate road network (routes on simple grid-based road networks require relatively few vertices).
Routes are generated from desire lines\index{desire lines} --- or more commonly origin-destination pairs --- using routing services which either run locally or remotely.


Instead of routing\index{routing} *all* desire lines generated in the previous section, which would be time and memory-consuming, we will focus on the desire lines\index{desire lines} of policy interest.
The benefits of cycling trips are greatest when they replace car trips.
Clearly, not all car trips can realistically be replaced by cycling.
However, 5 km Euclidean distance (or around 6-8 km of route distance) can realistically be cycled by many people, especially if they are riding an electric bicycle ('ebike').
We will therefore only route desire lines\index{desire lines} along which a high (300+) number of car trips take place that are up to 5 km in distance.
This routing\index{routing} is done by the **stplanr**\index{stplanr (package)} function `line2route()` which takes straight lines in `Spatial` or `sf` objects, and returns 'bendy' lines representing routes on the transport network\index{network} in the same class as the input.

```{r 12-transport-17, message=FALSE}
desire_lines$distance = as.numeric(st_length(desire_lines))
desire_carshort = dplyr::filter(desire_lines, car_driver > 300 & distance < 5000)
```




```{r 12-transport-18, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#route_carshort = line2route(desire_carshort, route_fun = route_osrm)
```
*******The first issue that I encountered was with "line2route()", which takes straight lines in Spatial or sf objects, and returns 'bendy' lines representing routes on the transport network in the same class as the input. We could keep the new route_carshort object separate from the straight line representation of the same trip in desire_carshort but,the chapter suggests that it makes more sense to combine them since they represent the same trip. Therefore, the line below can be ignored. 
However, I do think that the error occured because it couldn't locate the object 'route_osmr'. The 'line2route' function isn't running because of lack of appropriate package. I tried trouble shooting by adding various pacakages, but nothing seemed to work. However, I do thing that the error has to do with the 'stplanr' package. 

```{r}
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
library(spData)
library(spDataLarge)
library(tmap)    # for static and interactive maps
library(leaflet) # for interactive maps
library(mapview) # for interactive maps
library(ggplot2) # tidyverse data visualization package
library(shiny)   # for web applications
```


```{r 12-transport-19}
desire_carshort$geom_car = st_geometry(route_carshort)
```

This allows plotting the desire lines\index{desire lines} along which many short car journeys take place alongside likely routes traveled by cars by referring to each geometry column separately (`desire_carshort$geometry` and `desire_carshort$geom_car` in this case).


```{r routes, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Routes along which many (300+) short (<5km Euclidean distance) car journeys are made (red) overlaying desire lines representing the same trips (black) and zone centroids (dots).", echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, fig.scap="Routes along which many car journeys are made."}
# commented-out as it adds little to the chapter (RL)
plot(st_geometry(desire_carshort))
plot(desire_carshort$geom_car, col = "red", add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(st_centroid(zones_od)), add = TRUE)
```


## Nodes

Building on the analysis conducted in Section \@ref(desire-lines), public transport nodes\index{node} can be used to construct three-part desire lines\index{desire lines} for trips that can be taken by bus and (the mode used in this example) rail.
The first stage is to identify the desire lines\index{desire lines} with most public transport travel, which in our case is easy because our previously created dataset `desire_lines` already contains a variable describing the number of trips by train (the public transport potential could also be estimated using public transport routing\index{routing} services such as [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org/)).
To make the approach easier to follow, we will select only the top three desire lines\index{desire lines} in terms of rails use:

```{r 12-transport-20}
desire_rail = top_n(desire_lines, n = 3, wt = train)
```

The challenge now is to 'break-up' each of these lines into three pieces, representing travel via public transport nodes\index{node}.
This can be done by converting a desire line into a multiline object consisting of three line geometries representing origin, public transport and destination legs of the trip.
This operation can be divided into three stages: matrix creation (of origins, destinations and the 'via' points representing rail stations), identification of nearest neighbors\index{nearest neighbor} and conversion to multilines\index{multiline}.
These are undertaken by `line_via()`.
This **stplanr**\index{stplanr (package)} function takes input lines and points and returns a copy of the desire lines\index{desire lines} --- see the [Desire Lines Extended](https://geocompr.github.io/geocompkg/articles/linevia.html) vignette on the geocompr.github.io website and `?line_via` for details on how this works.
The output is the same as the input line, except it has new geometry columns representing the journey via public transport nodes\index{node}, as demonstrated below:

```{r 12-transport-21}
ncol(desire_rail)
desire_rail = line_via(desire_rail, bristol_stations)
ncol(desire_rail)
```

As illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:stations), the initial `desire_rail` lines now have three additional geometry list columns\index{list column} representing travel from home to the origin station, from there to the destination, and finally from the destination station to the destination.
In this case, the destination leg is very short (walking distance) but the origin legs may be sufficiently far to justify investment in cycling infrastructure to encourage people to cycle to the stations on the outward leg of peoples' journey to work in the residential areas surrounding the three origin stations in Figure \@ref(fig:stations).

```{r stations, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Station nodes (red dots) used as intermediary points that convert straight desire lines with high rail usage (black) into three legs: to the origin station (red) via public transport (gray) and to the destination (a very short blue line).", fig.scap="Station nodes."}
zone_cents = st_centroid(zones_od)
zone_cents_rail = zone_cents[desire_rail, ]
plot(desire_rail$geometry, expandBB = c(.1, .1, .1, .1))
plot(desire_rail$leg_orig, add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 3)
plot(desire_rail$leg_via, add = TRUE, col = "gray", lwd = 2)
plot(bristol_stations, add = TRUE, col = "red")
plot(desire_rail$leg_dest, add = TRUE, col = "blue", lwd = 5)
plot(zone_cents_rail, add = TRUE, col = "black")
# library(tmap)
# tmap_mode("plot")
# qtm(bristol_stations, basemaps = "https://{s}.tile.thunderforest.com/transport/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?apikey=feae177da543411c9efa64160305212d", dots.col = "red", symbols.size = 2) +
#   tm_shape(desire_rail) +
#   tm_lines(col = "black", lwd = 4) +
#   tm_shape(legs) +
#   tm_lines()
```

## Route networks
\index{network}
The data used in this section was downloaded using **osmdata**\index{osmdata (package)}.
To avoid having to request the data from OSM\index{OpenStreetMap} repeatedly, we will use the `bristol_ways` object, which contains point and line data for the case study area (see `?bristol_ways`):

```{r 12-transport-22}
summary(bristol_ways)
```

The above code chunk loaded a simple feature\index{sf} object representing around 3,000 segments on the transport network\index{network}.
This an easily manageable dataset size (transport datasets can be large, but it's best to start small).

As mentioned, route networks\index{network} can usefully be represented as mathematical graphs\index{graph}, with nodes\index{node} on the network\index{network} connected by edges\index{edge}.
A number of R packages have been developed for dealing with such graphs\index{graph}, notably **igraph**\index{igraph (package)}.
One can manually convert a route network into an `igraph` object, but the geographic attributes will be lost.
To overcome this issue `SpatialLinesNetwork()` was developed in the **stplanr**\index{stplanr (package)} package to represent route networks simultaneously as graphs *and* a set of geographic lines.
This function is demonstrated below using a subset of the `bristol_ways` object used in previous sections.

```{r 12-transport-23}
ways_freeway = bristol_ways %>% filter(maxspeed == "70 mph") 
ways_sln = SpatialLinesNetwork(ways_freeway)
slotNames(ways_sln)
weightfield(ways_sln)
class(ways_sln@g)
```

The output of the previous code chunk shows that `ways_sln` is a composite object with various 'slots'.
These include: the spatial component of the network\index{network} (named `sl`), the graph component (`g`) and the 'weightfield', the edge variable used for shortest path \index{shortest route} calculation (by default segment distance).
`ways_sln` is of class `sfNetwork`, defined by the S4 class\index{S4 class} system.
This means that each component can be accessed using the `@` operator, which is used below to extract its graph component and process it using the **igraph**\index{igraph (package)} package, before plotting the results in geographic space.
In the example below, the 'edge betweenness'\index{edge}, meaning the number of shortest paths\index{shortest route} passing through each edge, is calculated (see `?igraph::betweenness` for further details and Figure \@ref(fig:wayssln)).
The results demonstrate that each graph\index{graph} edge represents a segment: the segments near the center of the road network\index{network} have the greatest betweenness scores.


```{r wayssln, fig.cap="Illustration of a small route network, with segment thickness proportional to its betweenness, generated using the igraph package and described in the text.", fig.asp=0.8, out.width="60%", fig.scap="Illustration of a small route network."}
e = igraph::edge_betweenness(ways_sln@g)
plot(ways_sln@sl$geometry, lwd = e / 500)
```

```{r 12-transport-24, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# not producing groups of routes so removing for now...
m = igraph::clusters(ways_sln@g)
igraph::V(ways_sln@g)$m = m$membership
gdf = igraph::as_long_data_frame(ways_sln@g)
```



## Prioritizing new infrastructure

This chapter's final practical section demonstrates the policy-relevance of geocomputation for transport applications by identifying locations where new transport infrastructure may be needed.

The final code chunk of this chapter combines these strands of analysis.
It adds the car-dependent routes in `route_carshort` with a newly created object, `route_rail` and creates a new column representing the amount of travel along the centroid-to-centroid\index{centroid} desire lines they represent:




```{r 12-transport-25, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(spDataLarge)
library(stplanr) # geographic transport data package
library(tmap) 
library(dplyr)
library(sp)
library(sf)


#route_rail = desire_rail %>% 
 # st_set_geometry("leg_orig") %>% 
  #line2route(route_fun = route_osrm) %>% 
  #st_set_crs(4326)
```
****The error occured because it couldn't locate the object 'route_osmr'. Like mentioned previously, the 'line2route' function isn't running because of lack of appropriate package. I tried trouble shooting by adding various pacakages, but nothing seemed to work. However, I do thing that the error has to do with the 'stplanr' package. 

```{r 12-transport-26}
route_cycleway = rbind(route_rail, route_carshort)
route_cycleway$all = c(desire_rail$all, desire_carshort$all)
```

```{r 12-transport-27, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
n_trips = route_cycleway$all / 100
plot(route_cycleway["distance"], lwd = n_trips)
```

The results of the preceding code are visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:cycleways), which shows routes with high levels of car dependency and highlights opportunities for cycling rail stations (the subsequent code chunk creates a simple version of the figure --- see `code/12-cycleways.R` to reproduce the figure exactly).
The method has some limitations: in reality, people do not travel to zone centroids or always use the shortest route\index{shortest route} algorithm for a particular mode.
However, the results demonstrate routes along which cycle paths could be prioritized from car dependency and public transport perspectives.

```{r 12-transport-28, eval=FALSE}
qtm(route_cycleway, lines.lwd = "all")
```

```{r cycleways, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Potential routes along which to prioritise cycle infrastructure in Bristol, based on access key rail stations (red dots) and routes with many short car journeys (north of Bristol surrounding Stoke Bradley). Line thickness is proportional to number of trips.", fig.asp=0.8, out.width="70%", fig.scap="Routes along which to prioritise cycle infrastructure."}

```


The routes highlighted in the figure suggest that transport systems are intimately linked to the wider economic and social context.
The example of Stoke Bradley is a case in point:
its location, lack of public transport services and active travel infrastructure help explain why it is so highly car-dependent.
The wider point is that car dependency has a spatial distribution which has implications for sustainable transport policies 


## Exercises {#ex-transport}

1. What is the total distance of cycleways that would be constructed if all the routes presented in Figure \@ref(fig:cycleways) were to be constructed?
    - Bonus: find two ways of arriving at the same answer.

```{r 12-transport-29, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sum(route_cycleway$distance)
sum(st_length(route_cycleway))
```

2. What proportion of trips represented in the `desire_lines` are accounted for in the `route_cycleway` object?
    - Bonus: what proportion of trips cross the proposed routes?
    - Advanced: write code that would increase this proportion.

```{r 12-transport-30, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(spDataLarge)
library(stplanr)
library(tmap) 

#desire_carshort2 = dplyr::filter(desire_lines, car_driver > 200 & distance < 5000)
#route_carshort2 = line2route(desire_carshort2, route_fun = route_osrm) 
#route_cycleway2 = rbind(route_rail, route_carshort2)
#route_cycleway2$all = c(desire_rail$all, desire_carshort2$all)

#sum(route_cycleway2$all) / sum(desire_lines$all) 
#d_intersect = desire_lines[route_cycleway2, , op = st_crosses]
#sum(d_intersect$all) / sum(desire_lines$all) 
```




****The error occured because it couldn't locate the object 'route_osmr'. Like mentioned previously, the 'line2route' function isn't running because of lack of appropriate package. I tried trouble shooting by adding various pacakages, but nothing seemed to work. However, I do thing that the error has to do with the 'stplanr' package. If the function ran properly, the codes above would most probably work. 



3. The analysis presented in this chapter is designed for teaching how geocomputation methods can be applied to transport research. If you were to do this 'for real' for local government or a transport consultancy, what top 3 things would you do differently?

*******When I was reading the exercise, I was surprised that the research didn't emphasize on identifying key walking routes. I think identifying key walking routes will help target those specific areas to encourage bike rides especially electronic bikes. 
I would also perhaps use a higher level of geographic resolution.  Finally, identifying areas near biking routes that need bike shops would encourage people to utilize bikes more often. 

4. Clearly, the routes identified in Figure \@ref(fig:cycleways) only provide part of the picture. How would you extend the analysis to incorporate more trips that could potentially be cycled?

*******In my opinion, identifying where most short trips are taking place is the key to extend this analysis. For example, people that have short travel distance to their everyday job are more likely to adodt cycling rather than people that have to drive longer. Similarly, identifying populations near popular places like parks and markets and encouraging them to switch to cycling may help.  

5. Imagine that you want to extend the scenario by creating key *areas* (not routes) for investment in place-based cycling policies such as car-free zones, cycle parking points and reduced car parking strategy. How could raster\index{raster} data assist with this work? 
 
******Raster data analysis could help by providing useful aggregates of cycling potential at a constant level of geographic resolution. The raster cells with the highest estimated potential would be prioritised.
